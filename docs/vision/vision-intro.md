# Vision Introduction

Computer vision is a branch of programming that enables computers to interpret and understand visual information from the world. It involves the development of algorithms and models that can analyze images and videos, extract meaningful features, and make decisions based on visual data.

In FRC, Computer Vision is used to:
- Track the Robots position and orientation
- Identify and locate game pieces
- Plan and execute autonomous actions based on visual input
- Assist in driver control by providing visual feedback

## Key Software

- **PhotonVision**: A powerful and versatile vision processing library that simplifies the process of detecting and tracking objects in images. It provides a range of features, including camera calibration, object detection, and tracking algorithms.
- **Limelight**: A popular vision processing library and device that performs object-detection, tracking, and fiducial recognition. It is widely used in FRC for its ease of use and integration with various robot systems.
- **QuestNav**: A highly accurate vision software that uses a Meta Quest 3s to provide real-time positional and orientation data. It is very smooth and also can anchor to fidicual trackers on the field.

## Key Concepts
- **Camera Calibration**: The process of determining the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of a camera to accurately map 3D world coordinates to 2D image coordinates.
- **Object Detection**: The task of identifying and locating objects within an image or video stream. This can be done using various algorithms, such as YOLO (You Only Look Once), SSD (Single Shot Detector), or Faster R-CNN.
- **Tracking**: The process of continuously monitoring the position and movement of an object over time. This can be done using techniques like Kalman filters, optical flow, or feature matching.
- **Fiducial Markers**: Specially designed patterns or codes that can be easily detected and recognized by computer vision algorithms. They are often used for localization and tracking purposes in robotics.
- **Pose Estimation**: The process of determining the position and orientation of a camera or object in 3D space based on visual input. This is often done using techniques like PnP (Perspective-n-Point) algorithms or homography.
